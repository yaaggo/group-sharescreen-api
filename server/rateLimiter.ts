// file's neighbors already do for other things) specifically because its

// can't slowly leak memory the way a hand-rolled Map would without its own

// to every other participant — and that fan-out multiplies again if TURN
// relay candidates are in play (see iceConfig.ts) or someone shares both
// mic and screen at once. The client now spaces those opens out over time
// instead of firing them all in the same instant (see useRoomMedia.ts's
// openSendPCsStaggered/STAGGER_MS — a 50-person room's burst spreads across
// several seconds now, not one), which is what actually keeps a big room
// under this; the points value below is just extra headroom on top of
// that, sized generously because a dropped offer/answer here isn't retried
// anywhere near as reliably as other traffic (an offline-peer signal at
// least gets queued by deliverOrQueueSignal — this doesn't) — it just
// silently fails to connect that one peer, so the cost of this being too
// tight is much worse than the cost of it being generous. Still a real
